# Code of Conduct

The Quiz App project expects contributors to act professionally
and respectfully. Contributors are expected to maintain the safety
and dignity of the project's social environments (such as GitHub discussions and issues).

Specifically:

* Respect people, their identities, their culture, and their work.
* Be kind. Be courteous. Be welcoming.
* Listen. Consider and acknowledge people's points before responding.
* Focus on constructive feedback and collaborative problem-solving.

Should you experience anything that makes you feel unwelcome in the
Quiz App community, please contact the project maintainer at
[your GitHub issues](https://github.com/vicajilau/quiz_app/issues)
or directly reach out to [@vicajilau](https://github.com/vicajilau).

The Quiz App project will not tolerate harassment in the project's
community, even outside of the project's public communication channels.

## Conflict Resolution

When multiple contributors disagree on the direction for a particular
feature or the general direction of the project, the conflict should be
resolved by communication. The people who disagree should get
together, try to understand each other's points of view, and work to
find a solution that addresses everyone's concerns.

This is usually sufficient to resolve issues. If you cannot come to an
agreement, ask for guidance from the project maintainer or create a
GitHub discussion to involve the broader community.

Be wary of agreement by attrition, where one person argues a point
repeatedly until other participants give up. This is not conflict resolution,
as it does not address everyone's concerns. Be wary of agreement by
compromise, where two good competing solutions are merged into one
mediocre solution. A conflict is addressed when the participants agree
that the final solution is _better_ than all the conflicting proposals.

## Questions

It's always ok to ask questions. The Quiz App project covers multiple
areas (Flutter development, localization, AI integration, etc.), and
nobody will be an expert in all areas. Once you find the answer,
consider documenting it in the project's documentation or README
so the next person can be brought up to speed even quicker.

We encourage learning and knowledge sharing. If you're new to Flutter,
localization, or any technology used in this project, don't hesitate
to ask questions or request clarification.
